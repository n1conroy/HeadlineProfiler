# Real-Time News Story Profiler

WIP  project implements an automated pipeline to profile real-time news data by analyzing headlines to identify novel groups of related news stories. Designed as an unsupervised system, it clusters and extracts meaningful patterns from streaming news, supporting downstream innovation and verification tasks such as misinformation detection, trend discovery, and news recommendation.
News organizations and research teams increasingly need scalable tools to organize and analyze continuous streams of news content. This project addresses that by:

- Automatically grouping related news stories based on headline content and extracted features  
- Identifying emerging topics and novel story clusters without requiring labeled data or LLMs  
- Providing structured outputs that can feed into agentic AI pipelines for fact-checking, verification, and recommendation  
- Handling high-volume real-time data ingestion with modular, layered NLP and unsupervised modeling

## Key Features

- **Headline-driven clustering:** Uses headline text as primary input for unsupervised grouping  
- **Multi-layer NLP processing:** Includes text normalization, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering  
- **Unsupervised modeling:** Employs methods such as topic modeling, graph-based clustering, and embedding similarity without relying on pretrained large language models  
- **Real-time readiness:** Designed for continual ingestion and profiling of streaming news feeds  
- **Modular pipeline:** Clear separation of extraction, transformation, and prediction steps, enabling easy extension or integration with other tools  
- **Output for downstream use:** Produces cluster assignments, topic summaries, and relationship graphs to support downstream AI workflows, including agentic pipelines

## Intended Use Cases

- Grouping and tracking developing news stories in real time for newsrooms  
- Feeding novel story clusters into automated fact-checking and misinformation detection pipelines  
- Supporting research into news trends, topic innovation, and media analysis  
- Enhancing recommendation systems by identifying thematic news groups
